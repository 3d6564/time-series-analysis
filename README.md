## General Info

This repository is for ideas on analyzing time series data. The repository is 
structured with several folders in mind. The goal is to test different methods 
of visualizing time series basd data. Final goals will be to have some level of 
machine learning applied. 

Folder structure: 
- *data* is where all data files will reside. 
- *figs* is where all figures will be sent as a *.png* file type.


## Circular Axis Plot

#### About

Language:
- R

Packages:
- tidyverse
- ggplot2


#### Data

The data is semi-random generated in Excel. The desire was to show a potential 
trend of events based on time of day, time of month, or time of year.

#### Figure

The figure, *0_event-category-hourday.png*, plots four different event
categories across hours in the day by days in the month.
